Observer Pattern:
- realization of the publish-subscribe principle
- observer:
    o interface defined by abstract class
    o abstract class provides an update function
    o observers need to subscribe to the publisher
- publisher:
    o maintains a list of observers
    o via notify function all observers are updated
