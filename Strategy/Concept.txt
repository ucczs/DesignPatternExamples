Example:
Strategy: Distance calculation
Context:
    o Collision warner uses a algorightm to calculate the Distance
    o alogrithm is a member of collision warner class of type CDistanceAlgorithm (abstract class)
    o based on number of objects in map it is decided which algorithm to use by changing the member of collision warner via set function
